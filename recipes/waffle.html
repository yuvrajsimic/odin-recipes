    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Made with basic pantry ingredients, this quick & easy Classic Homemade Waffles recipe is infused with cinnamon and maple syrup in every bite.</p>

    <p>There are some waffle recipes that require the careful addition of egg whites and several steps to achieve light, fluffy waffles. And there are yeasted waffles recipes that depend on an overnight rise – although fantastically delicious, not always practical or convenient. But this waffles recipe is not one of those.</p>

    <p>The batter is simple, made with common ingredients, but I included two secret additions – cinnamon and maple syrup – to give them a touch of warm flavor throughout.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Whole Milk</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Vanilla</li>
        <li>Maple Syrus</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat waffle iron.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs with wire whisk until fluffy, then add milk and melted butter. Mix dry ingredients into egg mixture, mixing just until lumps are out.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into waffle iron, consult owner's manual for exact amount. Close lid of waffle iron.</li>
        <li>Bake about 5 minutes, until iron stops steaming. Carefully remove and serve with warmed maple syrup, fresh berries or sliced bananas. I also like to warm a bit of strawberry jam into a syrup. Enjoy!</li>
